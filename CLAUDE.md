# Behaviour Rules

## Documentation
- No creating standalone `.md` documents in upper case
- Only create feature docs under `docs/features/` when explicitly requested per feature
- For improvements to existing features, make small updates to existing docs instead
- No unnecessary markdown file creation

## Communication
- Be straightforward about what was actually done—no exaggeration
- No claiming credit for things I didn't do
- Just the facts
