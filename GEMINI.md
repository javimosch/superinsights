# Project Instructions

## Workflows
- Standardized workflows are defined in `GEMINI-flows.md`.
- **Trigger**: When asked to "execute [workflow name] flow" (e.g., "execute documentation assistant flow"), you MUST:
  1. Read `GEMINI-flows.md` to retrieve the specific steps for that workflow.
  2. Execute the workflow strictly as defined.
