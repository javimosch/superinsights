Summary of the Idea

A unified analytics and monitoring platform that tracks page views, events, JavaScript errors, and performance metrics, all fed into a customizable dashboard. It includes connectors (Slack, Jira, GitHub, webhooks), automated reports, and optional collaboration features like in-app chat and a task management module. Designed to be self-hosted or cloud-hosted, the platform provides full ownership of data while replacing traditional analytics, error monitoring, and PM tools with a single, integrated solution.

In one line:

You’re solving the tool fragmentation problem by building a unified, self-hosted platform that gives teams complete visibility, control, and collaboration in one place — with far less cost and complexity.
