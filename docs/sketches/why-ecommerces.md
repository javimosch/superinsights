## **Why Focus on E-Commerce First**

### **1. E-commerce has the clearest, most measurable impact from analytics**

Every action (clicks, views, scrolls, add-to-carts, errors, slow pages) directly affects:

* conversion rate
* average order value
* cart abandonment
* revenue

This makes your platform **immediately valuable** because improvements can be tied to profit.
No other vertical has such tight coupling between analytics → performance → revenue.

---

### **2. E-commerce suffers the most from tool fragmentation**

Most stores use a chaotic mix of:

* Google Analytics for traffic
* Hotjar for behavior
* Sentry for errors
* Shopify/BigCommerce analytics
* Klaviyo for events
* PageSpeed tools
* Custom reports in spreadsheets

Your platform replaces all this with a **single, unified system** that:

* tracks
* correlates
* explains
* alerts
* visualizes
  …in one place.

---

### **3. E-commerce performance issues = instant revenue loss**

Slow pages or broken scripts can destroy conversion rates within minutes.
But most merchants only find out *after* revenue drops.

Focused alerts, dashboards, and insights for e-commerce give them:

* real-time warnings
* correlated insights (“performance drop affected checkout”)
* auto-prioritized issues
* revenue at risk calculations

This is an instant competitive advantage.

### **4. E-commerce has predictable events and funnels**

You can build **predefined, out-of-the-box analytics**:

* product view
* add to cart
* begin checkout
* shipping step
* payment step
* purchase

Shops don’t need custom configuration — it “just works.”

---

### **5. Huge market, underserved in self-hosted space**

Shopify stores, WooCommerce, Magento, custom headless setups — all want:

* privacy
* data ownership
* real-time insights
* lightweight scripts
* fewer tools
* lower cost

But **no modern, unified, self-hosted analytics platform** exists specifically for e-commerce.

This is a gap you can dominate.

## **In essence:**

Focusing on e-commerce gives you **maximum value, fastest adoption, clearest ROI, and the strongest differentiation**. Then you can expand into other verticals once the platform matures.

If you want, I can write:
